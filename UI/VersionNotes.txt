v0.2 - 20/NOV/2020
<color yellow>Beta-2 version:</color>
<color cyan>- Parameterized box generation for vehicles texts</color>
Useful to create a container to fit better the texts in vehicles. Specially useful for destination boards.

<color cyan>- Changes in road destination mapping system</color>
The system used to generate procedural destination boards was removed. Now you can place them directly at segments that you want, and customize the texts via parameters (4 reference targets to extract text + up to 8 text parameters). 
Also added an option to place a simple prop instead of a built layout. It makes all Procedural Objects' mod workshop assets compatible with Write The Signs, once you can assemble props as you can do there now.

<color cyan>- Lights are on!</color>
Fixed light system from props placed with Write the Signs. Available in Building, Road Corners and On Segment Placing modes!

<color cyan>- Time & temperature dynamic text</color>
New option that generates a switching text between current time and temperature in the city. Functional digital clocks are now possible!

<color cyan>- Bug fixes</color>
A lot of fixes were done. Main ones:
- Increased performance
- Fixed flickering props at buildings
- Fixed some i18n errors
- Fixed neutral white text tone
- Other minor fixes
