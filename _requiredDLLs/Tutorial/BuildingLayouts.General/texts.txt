This tab will allow you to create a custom text layout to any building in the game. This is done in the game mode and can create an unique layout for the city, if you want.
Requires the props layouts have been done before start the layout setting here.

Use the mod <color yellow>Camera Positions Utility</color> to see the props from near, and place them correctly.
Also, all icon buttons have tooltips. Check them to know what they can do for you!
